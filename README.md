Data Analysis and Model Building of CyberSecurity Data

Description:
This projects includes a report-cs (1). which has cyber security data in it. 
We perform data preprocessing, analysis and model building on the data set.
We can predict if an item is TP, FP, Begnin or Incident
Used: Python, Librarries: sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas.
The performance of thge model is good but can be improved.

We perform data preprocessing:
Cleaning
Normalisation
Encoding
Missing Value Handling
Data Analysis:
Feature Construction
Visualization
Central Tendency
Model Building:
Built models 
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier and 
Logistic Regression Classifier
Accuracy of each is checked and compared.
